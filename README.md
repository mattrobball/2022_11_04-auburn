## Generation in prime characteristic 

Finite dimensional vector spaces have a simple classification mechanism - 
compute the dimension. Vector spaces with additional operators have 
more complicated classification structure but it can still be done via 
finite amount of linear algebraic data. If the operators satisfy identities, 
then we can no longer guarantee this. 

We discussed this and how using Frobenius pushforwards remedies the situation 
in finite characteristic.

### About this setup

This is a colloquium talk I gave at Auburn. 

The presentation uses the [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) framework, the 
[KaTeX](katex.org) engine to render math, and is hosted 
with [GitHub Pages](pages.github.com).

Reveal.js comes with server which hot reloads on changes to the html files. If you 
don't have your own server, I recommend using this. 

To use this as template for your talk, first install node. The simplest way 
for an up-to-date version is via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/README.md). 
Then install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm). 

Next, clone this repository. Inside the main folder of the repository, run 
`npm install` to build the node module dependencies. 

Run `npm start` to initialize the server. It will provide a url address for the server. 

Now edit `index.html` to author your talk and point your favorite browser to 
the url to see the results. 

To enable access via the internet, set up [GitHub Pages](pages.github.com).
